NFT-SHIELD

Overview

NFT-SHIELD is a blockchain-based solution that aims to replace traditional physical warranty cards with on-chain Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). Deployed on the Mumbai Matic Testnet, the smart contract generates NFTs that serve as digital warranty cards. These NFTs allow users to prove ownership of items, provide purchasing history, warranty period, and other relevant item information. These NFTs are designed to decay over time, meaning that they will expire and burn after a certain period.

The project includes a user-friendly GUI-based tool that does not require any prior knowledge of blockchain programming, making it easy for brands and retailers to use.

Features

* Ownership Proof: The smart contract allows users to prove ownership of their items using NFTs, which are securely stored on the blockchain.
* Purchasing History: The NFTs generated by the smart contract store the purchasing history of items, creating a transparent and immutable record of transactions.
* Warranty Information: The smart contract includes warranty information, such as the warranty period and other item details, that can be accessed through the NFTs.
* Decay Feature: The NFTs generated by the smart contract are designed to decay over time, meaning that their use for warranty redemption expires after a certain period, providing time-bound warranty benefits.
* User-friendly GUI Tool: The project provides a user-friendly GUI-based tool that does not require any blockchain programming knowledge, making it accessible for brands and retailers to manage their warranty processes.
* On-chain Transactions: The project utilizes Matic tokens to facilitate transparent and secure transactions between buyers and sellers, storing all transaction data on-chain.
